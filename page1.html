                Gorillas, which are the largest living primates, An average silverback gorilla can weigh up to 
                180kg, and measure 170cm tall on all fours. In contrast, female mountain gorillas weigh 90kg, and measure up to 150cm (4’9”).
                are native to the  forests of central and sub-Saharan Africa. They can be found in many other locations but in africa is ideal.
                These gentle herbivores primarily sustain themselves 
                by consuming leaves, stems, and fruits. Gorillas are highly social animals, i am sure we have all seen videos online of 
                a gorilla having a friendly human interaction with someone with ease and no harm.  
                Remarkably intelligent, gorillas exhibit tool usage and employ a 
                variety of vocalizations and body language for communication. 
                There are two distinct species of gorillas: the eastern gorillas and the 
                western gorillas. The mountain gorilla, a subspecies of the eastern gorilla, 
                is tragically critically endangered, underscoring the urgent need for conservation efforts.
                These creatures, which share an astonishing 98% of their DNA with humans, 
                captivate with their gentle nature and complex social interactions,
                making their protection and the preservation of their natural habitats vital endeavors.

                Penguins are fascinating birds 
                that have adapted to life in some of the world's 
                harshest environments. These flightless birds are 
                primarily found in the Southern Hemisphere, with some 
                species inhabiting regions as far south as Antarctica. 
                Penguins are excellent swimmers and are known for their 
                agility underwater. Their bodies are streamlined for swimming, 
                with flippers that serve as powerful paddles. Despite their comical waddling 
                on land, penguins are incredibly graceful in the water. They seem like the sweetest animals ever. They primarily feed on 
                fish and using their sharp beaks to catch prey. Penguins are highly social animals, 
                often forming large colonies for breeding and protection. They are also known for their 
                distinctive black and white plumage, which helps them blend in with their surroundings
                while swimming and provides some protection from predators. Penguins are a symbol of 
                resilience and adaptability, thriving in some of the world's most extreme conditions.

                Tigers are regal large cats distinguished by their eye-catching orange coat with black stripes. 
                Known for their power and agility, they are the largest of the big cat species. 
                Tigers are mostly found in Asia and live in a variety of various environments, 
                including meadows and deep jungles. With their strong jaws and cutting-edge fangs, 
                these predators can jump on prey like deer, boar, and even bigger animals like buffalo. 
                Tigers are solitary creatures, with each one creating and protecting 
                its own territory. Despite their solitary lifestyle, they are known 
                to enjoy bathing and cooling off in rivers and lakes because they are skilled
                swimmers. Sadly, habitat destruction and poaching for their prized body parts have 
                led to the extinction of tigers. There are conservation efforts. Lions can be pretty dangerous to humans
                but they are amazing animals that you can view from a distance.
